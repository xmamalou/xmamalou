#### Hello there!
I am a student at the University of Athens, in the Physics department. I love math, 
computers, programming and games. I know how to program in C, C++ and Haskell. I also know some LaTeX and Bash and a bit of Forth.

I am mostly interested in programming stuff for fun so I don't tend to make very big or concise projects. 
However, I sometimes try to make something that is intended 
to have a more practical use ([Science Tex](https://github.com/xmamalou/science-tex), [Dragonfly](https://github.com/xmamalou/dragonfly)).
My current area of interest when it comes to programming is graphics.

Other interests include art, 3D modelling, world building and linguistics.
