#### Hello there!
I am a student at the University of Athens, in the Physics department. I love math, 
computers, and games. I know how to program in C, C++ and Haskell. I also know some LaTeX and Bash.

I am mostly interested in programming stuff for fun so I don't tend to make very big or concise projects. My current area of interest when it comes to programming is graphics and APIs like Vulkan or CUDA.

Other interests include art, world building, and linguistics.
