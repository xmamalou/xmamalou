Hello from ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· Greece!

I am:
- Knowledgeable in Haskell, C, Bash and LaTeX. I have started learning C#, which I find fun. I also know a bit of CSS and HTML, but I am not a fan.
- A physics undergrad and math enthusiast
- Interested in low level, parallel and functional programming, in GPU programming, in computer graphics and numerical analysis
- Professionally unprofessional

I mostly use C and Haskell for either my personal projects or projects related to my field of studies. My environment of choice is Windows (11), but I also know my way around Linux.
